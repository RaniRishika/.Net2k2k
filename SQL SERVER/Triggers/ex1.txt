For example, let's say you want to send an email to the Sales Manager when an order is entered whose priority is high.

CREATE TABLE Orders (Ord_ID int IDENTITY, Ord_Priority varchar(10))
go
CREATE TRIGGER tr_Orders_INSERT
ON Orders
FOR INSERT
AS
IF ((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM inserted WHERE Ord_Priority = 'High') = 1)
 BEGIN
  PRINT 'Email Code Goes Here'
 END
go
INSERT Orders (Ord_Priority) VALUES ('High')

-- Results --

Email Code Goes Here
